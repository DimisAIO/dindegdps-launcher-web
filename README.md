# DindeGDPS - Web Folder
On DindeGDPS' default mode, there is a "browser" that serves as a welcome screen. It contains socials, settings and credits.

On the next DindeGDPS release, other languages will be supported too! The goal of this repo is to let people translate this browser in their own language!

## Translation
* On [installed_langs.txt](https://github.com/DimisAIO/dindegdps-launcher-web/blob/main/installed_langs.txt), add a slash followed by your country's name (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
* On [libdinde-locale.js](https://github.com/DimisAIO/dindegdps-launcher-web/blob/main/js/libdinde-locale.js), copy a value (en, fr, whatever), translate it and paste the edited version on the file (es, ...)
